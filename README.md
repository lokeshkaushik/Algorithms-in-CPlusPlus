Algorithms-in-C--
=================

My implementation of basic algorithms from The Algorithm Design manual by Skiena.


Inorder to compile, create a new project using Xcode, and add the files from these repository to the project. All the calls to test the functions are written in main.cpp. I will be adding additional calls as and when i add new functions to the project.

Alternatively you can create a makefile to compile the sources in a binary and launch it. However i prefer it using a IDE for better readability of code.
